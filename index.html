        </blockquote>
        <p>Lionel Andrés Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. From a young age, he displayed exceptional football talent but was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency at 10. In 2000, FC Barcelona offered to pay for his treatment, and he moved to Spain, joining La Masia, the club’s youth academy.

            Messi made his senior debut for Barcelona in 2004 at just 17. Over 17 years, he won 10 La Liga titles, 4 UEFA Champions Leagues, and 6 European Golden Shoes, becoming Barcelona’s all-time top scorer (672 goals). In 2012, he set a record by scoring 91 goals in a calendar year. Due to financial constraints, he left in 2021 and joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), winning two Ligue 1 titles. In 2023, he moved to Inter Miami, boosting the popularity of Major League Soccer (MLS).
            
            Internationally, Messi endured heartbreak in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final but led Argentina to victory in the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, solidifying his legacy.
            
            Messi has won a record 8 Ballon d’Or awards and is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. Off the field, he is married to Antonela Roccuzzo, with whom he has three sons. Through the Leo Messi Foundation, he supports various charities. His humility, talent, and dedication have made him an enduring football icon.</p>
